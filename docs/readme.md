Have passed since the start of this project on June 22nd, 2024 to the end of it, on July 15th 2025, we built an operating system simulation that helped hundreds start their own system projects, and helped us understand more about python, operating systems, and modules. This is not just a piece of software, and not a crappy os simulation nobody cares about, but a project. A community. A story. The story of SkyOS.

## Description
An os built FROM SCRATCH! It's open-source and easy to contribute to
because it is written in python, a very easy language to learn and program in.
