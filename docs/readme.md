# 388 days
9312 hours, 558,200 minutes, 33,523,200 seconds. That much time. Has passed since the start of this project on June 22nd, 2024 to the end of it, on July 15th 2025, we built an operating system simulation that helped hundreds start their own system projects, and helped us understand more about python, operating systems, and modules. This is not just a piece of software, and not a crappy os simulation nobody cares about, but a project. A community. A story. The story of SkyOS.
