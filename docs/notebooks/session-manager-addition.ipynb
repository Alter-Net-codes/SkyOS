    "The session manager is implemented to handle user sessions within the system. It is responsible for tracking active sessions, managing user authentication, and ensuring that session data is securely stored and retrieved. The implementation likely involves creating a session object for each user, storing session information in memory or a database, and providing methods to create, validate, and terminate sessions as needed. The session manager integrates with the rest of the system to provide a seamless and secure user experience."
